            <p>
                Hello. My name is Koya and I teach piano at my home in Lynnwood, Washington.
                    I have experience teaching children. I have a somewhat flexible schedule and
                    can teach a lesson anywhere between 30 and 60 minutes.* 
                    You have to buy your own books. (Sorry. Mines have all of my notes and it's quite impossible to 
                    read the music with all of my notes on it.)
                    I use flash cards to help students remember musical terms quickly and accurately.
